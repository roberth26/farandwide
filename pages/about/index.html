                    <h2>About Our Unique Studio</h2>
                    <p>
                        Far and Wide Studios is a group of four women with a
                        passion for creating and bringing stories to life
                        through animation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The studio was originally founded as a group of students
                        selected for a Summer Arts workshop in 2017. During this
                        rigorous course, the students worked together as a
                        studio mentored by Aubry Mintz and Nimble Collective to
                        finish a short film in only two weeks. Using Nimble
                        Collective's revolutionary cloud-based studio platform,
                        they successfully finished the film and made lasting
                        memories and friendships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because this team consisted of students from all over
                        the world, they named their studio "Far and Wide". This
                        name holds true today as a few members, inspired by
                        Nimble Collective's cloud-based custiod, continue
                        creating together remotely with its growing members and
                        collaborators dispersed across the US and Canada.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Relying on an entirely remote pipeline over the past 3
                        years has taught Far and Wide Studios independence,
                        reliability, and most of all: the important of a strong
                        team spirit with a passion to inspire others.
