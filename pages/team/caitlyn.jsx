    Caitlyn Cardoza is a 3D Character Modeler and aspiring Art Director. After
    graduating from California State University, Fresno, she joined a workshop
    and took a few outside courses with Gnomon to further her skills.
    Considering herself to be a positive and passion-driven person, she has
    self-taught herself Zbrush, 3D Coat, and Blender over the past few years and
    currently is learning Substance Painter. In her spare time she works as a
    manager at a doogie daycare, getting to live her best life by giving herself
    to both her passions: animals and 3D animation.

  <p>
    She is proud to have co-founded the Far and Wide Studios because the process
    is reimagining the way teams collaborate and has given opportunities to
    artists of all skill levels to give their input in making Inspire. She knows
    Inspire will be universal and hopes that the film&rsquo;s truths and message
    can spread as far as possible and touch all who watch it.

    Caitlyn is living her best life in the San Francisco Bay Area, with her two
    dogs and boyfriend, taking life one day at a time and going where the wind
    blows her.
