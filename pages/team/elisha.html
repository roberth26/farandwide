          Elisha Kantor is a 3D Character Animator who has a passion for
          capturing the emotions of characters through their facial expressions.
          She has loved to draw characters and portraits since she was little,
          and animation has given her the creative freedom to really breathe
          life into characters. She received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in
          Computer Animation and Game Development at CSU Chico as a first
          generation college student.

          She currently resides in Redding, California with her husband, son,
          and little dog Teddy. She also enjoys singing, playing guitar, and
          exploring the outdoors around beautiful Northern California and
          Southern Oregon wilderness with her family.

          Elisha loves being a part of Far and Wide Studios not only because it
          is solely remote, so they can work together no matter what city (or
          country!) they live in, but because the opportunity to build a story
          together from the ground up has been an absolute dream.
