                    Myrka Sanchez is a Key Creative for Far and Wide Studios,
                    and a 3D Character Animator. Her love of art began as a
                    young girl exploring her admiration for animals and
                    wildlife, mimicking what she saw and awed at in the world on
                    paper. Her life continued to lead her down the artful path,
                    leading her to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Animation in
                    2017. The collaborative founding of Far and Wide has brought
                    not only great creative milestones, but also lasting,
                    meaningful relationships&mdash;all via the web! Striving
                    together to create such an intensely personal and relatable
                    story has been a wonderful challenge, and is something she
                    hops to continue to do for the rest of her life.

                    Myrka currently lives in Los Angeles, and has a dachshund
                    named Emilio and a cat named Misu, who remind her of what's
                    important every day. On the weekends, you can catch her
                    either cruisin' the streets on her motorcycle or gaming
                    online with friends, (after her animation quota is complete,
                    that is!).
