  <p>
    Myrka Sanchez is a Key Creative for Far and Wide Studios, and a 3D Character
    Animator. Her love of art began as a young girl exploring her admiration for
    animals and wildlife, mimicking what she saw and awed at in the world on
    paper. Her life continued to lead her down the artful path, leading her to
    graduate with a B.S. in Computer Animation in 2017. The collaborative
    founding of Far and Wide has brought not only great creative milestones, but
    also lasting, meaningful relationships&mdash;all via the web! Striving
    together to create such an intensely personal and relatable story has been a
    wonderful challenge, and is something she hops to continue to do for the
    rest of her life.

    Myrka currently lives in Los Angeles, and has a dachshund named Emilio and a
    cat named Misu, who remind her of what&rsquo;s important every day. On the
    weekends, you can catch her either cruisin&rsquo; the streets on her
    motorcycle or gaming online with friends, (after her animation quota is
    complete, that is!).
